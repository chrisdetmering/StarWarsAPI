## Summary

Back in 2014 I was determined to become a programmer. After reading the Head First Javascript book, I wasn't sure what project to work on. I eventually landed on Tetris.

* Used Axios to make GET requests to the SWAPI API
Used Promise.all to aggregating the results of multiple promises
Built UI and handled front end state with React Hooks (useState, useEffect) 
Cached results in localStorage to make reloading instantaneous 
Made custom React  component to handle making sub API calls
